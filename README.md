# Lane-Detection-by-Dashcam-Videos
For my ENGR 133 Individual Project, I developed a real-time lane detection system using Python and OpenCV that processes driving footage and identifies lane boundaries through a classical computer-vision pipeline. The program converts each video frame to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection, isolates the road using a region-of-interest mask, and then uses the Probabilistic Hough Transform to extract lane line segments. It overlays the detected lanes onto the video and outputs an annotated MP4 file, demonstrating how autonomous vehicles interpret roadway structure. Through this project, I strengthened my skills in image processing, algorithm design, and modular software development while building a functional prototype inspired by real ADAS technology.
